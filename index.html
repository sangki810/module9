            The color for the navbar was chosen to reflect the color scheme of the marvel logo. The different pages in the navbar represents the 
            first four phases in the Marvel Cinematic Universe as well as this page which holds the discussion for the design and results of various tests.
            The navbar is also responsively positioned and changes into a drop-down menu when viewed in a small screen. The background color for the pages 
            as well as the sections were chosen to be dark to reflect the inside of a movie theater and the general feeling of watching a movie. The footer 
            was chosen due to its simplicity as the page navigation already exists in the navbar. The format of each content pages differ from 1 & 2 and 
            3 & 4 as the first and second half were created by separate people. However, the general theme is the same in that they hold four sections with 
            images and text that are responsively positioned. The overall font for the site was chosen not just for its looks but also for its name 
            "Marvel", as the name and appearance are both fitting for the content of the pages. 
            <br><br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The various tests that were performed on this site were the validator.nu test to check for errors in the 
            HTML files and the Google Lighthouse test to check for performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO on both mobile and desktop formats.
            The validator.nu test pointed out a few errors that were fixed until no errors were shown. However, mulitple tests showed that the HTML file 
            should be marked as something other than lang="en" from time to time as the text in the content pages are lorem ipsum. The rest of the tests
            from Lighthouse also showed positive results as the performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO gave scores of 97, 95, 100, and 91 
            respectively. All in all the pages were built on robust foundation.
